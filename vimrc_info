This is default vim 6/3/2021
plus my config.

In case no vimrc it uses the $(VIMRUNTIME)/defaults.vim
Any _vimrc puted in $HOME, $VIM and  $VIMRUNTIME and after sourced(inside vim edito , source (% or path)), will overwrite default.vim, not sure about precednences

go to /etc/vim/vim82/vimrc and add set exrc , after that local (in directory) _vimrc will overwrite prev _vimrc config

My shorkey:

new tab -> CTRL-t
close tab -> CTRL-w
next tab -> CTRL-m
prev tab -> CTRL-n

toogle number lies -> CTRL-l
